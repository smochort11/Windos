# Windos
Windos is a little project I made.

It is a parody of Windows, a Microsoft product.

I gove it to yu here on Github, so you can look at it and tell me what to do next, or modify it.

I accept mods, just send them to me at szymonmochort11@gmail.com, I accept both attachments and links. no URL shortneners, please.

Standard releases are loacted im Master, and pr releases have a pull request tied to them.
Pretty easy if you've used Git before.
